# Reeply

Like [RPLY](https://x.com/mollycantillon/status/1887569755772793000), but for Android? Maybe.

Not sure how I feel about like a CRM-for-texts, but it seems fun to build. Takes inspiration from Happenstance.ai, too.

## To-dos

- [x] Move files under `reeply`
- [ ] Build the sync engine for pulling SMS data
- [ ] Build AI drafts (maybe on-demand)
- [ ] Build the autofill engine (via Windows?)
